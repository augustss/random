# The Haskell Standard Library

## Random Number Generation

### MHS version
This a fork of the `random` package to be able to compile it with MicroHs.
The `random` package maintainers do not want to these changes.
This package still works with GHC.

### Description

This library provides a basic interface for (splittable) pseudo-random number
generators.

The API documentation can be found here:

An [older version][haskell98-version] of this library is included with GHC in
the `haskell98` package. This newer version is included in the [Haskell
Platform][haskell-platform].

Please report bugs in the [GitHub issue tracker][issue-tracker] (no longer in
the GHC trac).
